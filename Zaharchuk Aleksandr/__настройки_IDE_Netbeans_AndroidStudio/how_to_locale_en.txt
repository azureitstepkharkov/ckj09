I installed NetBeans 8.2 and can't change hte UI language. I didn't find any option for it. Any suggestions? I use this process but it is not working

Find netbeans etc, likely at the C:\Program Files\NetBeans 8.2\etc
Open netbeans.conf
Find netbeans_default_options
Add those options, so: netbeans_default_options="blablabla - J-Duser.language=en -J-Duser.region=US"
Save file
Restart/start netbeans.
